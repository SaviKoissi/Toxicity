# Toxicity
We first published the code in 2017 and since them, the subject is still relevant due to the number of people who reached out to me. The objective of the following project is to initiate the detection of the lethal concentration of pesticides or insecticide. The detection of such concentration can be difficult especially when natural death occurred in the experimental unit. Therefore, we require a systematic way to the determination of such as lethal concentration using the Abbott correction. This obviously, a reinitialization of the work and make the code available for a larger community. We ambition to write not only a comprehensive code but also to latter elaborate a more efficient that will ease the workload for a larger community.
